		bats-assert is a helper library providing common assertions for Bats.

		Assertions are functions that perform a test and output relevant
		information on failure to help debugging. They return 1 on failure and
		0 otherwise. Output, formatted for readability, is sent to the standard
		error to make assertions usable outside of @test blocks too.

		Assertions testing exit code and output operate on the results of the
		most recent invocation of run.
